# Loye_Wali_App
A Complete Solution for Iron/ Steel Rods Vendors with Firebase authentication and Firebase storage.
In this app, we have implemented user authentication using Firebase. We have provided each user with
facility to store his data about stock, orders, and history of order in the app. The data is stored
in the Firebase database and can be access at any time, any where. We have implemented these basic
functionalities that was of core need for Rod vendors. We have also introduced the feature of showing
notification when the stock drops below 5 in quantity.
